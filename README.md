💳 Banking Console App (Java)
A simple and robust console-based banking application built using Java. Designed to simulate core banking functionalities like account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance tracking — all from the command line.

🚀 Features
Java (JDK 17+) - Core application logic written in modern Java

OOP Principles - Clean architecture using classes and objects

User Authentication - Simple login system for secure access

Account Management - Create, view, and manage bank accounts

Transaction Support - Deposit, withdraw, and check balance

Modular Codebase - Separated logic for improved readability and scalability

Error Handling - Robust validation and exception handling

Console UI - Clean and intuitive text-based user interaction
